# Traditional-Sorting-Algorithm-Ananlyzer

This project analyzes the time complexity taken by the sorting algorithms such as Bubble sort , Insertion Sort and Selection Sort .
This algorithm consists of the **optimized** code and time complexity of that of the traditional ones .

The project requirements are as follows
- streamlit
- A notepad with all the numbers

  The numbers are sorted and displayed and then the **original** algorithms time vs the **optimized** algorithms time is displayed and results are shown using a graph.
